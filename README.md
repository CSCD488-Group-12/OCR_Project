# OCR_Project
The OCR project for team 12 in Dr.Tappan's CSCD488 in '25. This project will use an Azure Static Web app to host a website that will allow users to convert images containing text into a digitally editable text-file format. To use the tool, navigate to the website at """https://kind-stone-06683921e.6.azurestaticapps.net""" and make a new note. Select the image file with text taht you would like to extract, and if applicable, crop the image to contain only the text. Clicking "Submit" will open a popup that lets you confirm or cancel, and after processing, the popup will also contain the final text and a "share" button to chare the output.
