# OCR Note Taker project
**Capture. Convert. Create.**

This project is a web-based OCR tool that empowers users to convert images containing text into a digitally editable text-file format. To use the tool, navigate to the website at https://kind-stone-06683921e.6.azurestaticapps.net and make a new note. Select the image file with text that you would like to extract, and if applicable, crop the image to contain only the text. Clicking "Submit" will open a popup that lets you confirm or cancel the extraction, and after processing, the popup will also contain the final text and a "share" button to share the output.
